# **DECRED x DECENT - FUNDING PROPOSAL**

**What?**

Approval for funding the development of the creative concept **‘Another Way’** alongside a range of supporting resources and assets. 

**Why?**

Since Bitcoin, no other project has succeeded in carving out a truly distinct and differentiated brand positioning.  

When asked what could kill Decred, on the Decred In Depth Podcast, both JZ and Murad Mahmudov answered the same… “Apathy”.  

 Much has been written about the technical decisions that made Bitcoin possible but it was the cultural relevance that made it a movement... 

    - ‘Satoshi architected the perfect genetic code necessary to a new species of money, Bitcoin. He then waited for the precise moment to plant the new species, the 2008 Financial Crisis. At that moment, he distributed the whitepaper to the only group that cared — the Cypherpunks. And finally, he nurtured Bitcoin to a stage where it no longer needed him’- Dan Held, Planting Bitcoin

For Decred to succeed it will need to marry strong technical foundations with a distinct and cohesive cultural narrative that can evolve over time as the project matures, turning a respected project into an exciting and aspirational social movement that can stand out in a sea of confusing crypto projects.  

Currently Decred is positioned as ‘a new kind of workplace’. We believe this product benefit can be positioned in a far more emotionally resonant and impactful way…  

‘Decred offers another way of working’. In fact when seen through this simple idea, Decred’s entire value proposition is around Another Way to do things…  

  - Another Way to govern
  - Another Way to fund
  - Another Way to create

The genius of Satoshi Nakamoto wasn’t to release a whitepaper or to solve the Byzantine General’s problem, it was to show, at exactly the right moment in time, that there was **another way**, a real alternative to the existing status quo - something that seemed impossible... right up until the moment it wasn’t.  

Just as Nike made ‘Just Do It’ the world’s most famous slogan, imbuing lifeless running shoes with personality and motivation that inspired a generation, so we believe **Another Way** can be a rallying cry to a new generation who are challenging long held assumptions and firmly held beliefs at a point in the world when change is desperately needed and hope is in short supply.

We believe that **Another Way** is a powerful idea that will resonate with a diverse range of people from all cultures and all corners of the world. It is an idea that distills Decred’s ethos, values and reason for being into a simple and memorable positioning that can offer a wide range of creative executions.  

**How?**  

 **Another Way** is the central big idea from which we introduce individuals, collectives, ideas, cultures, experiences, research, events and technology from around the world - intelligently exposing and deconstructing the fractures in our existing systems before introducing paths forward to the frontiers of emerging systems, cultures and communities.

 Connecting people, purpose and planet, **Another Way** will become a field manual for a rapidly changing world, connecting the interweaving stories of a globally distributed network of people and projects.  

 We would be contracted to deliver a development project that would create a range of materials and assets that would be used to gain trust the community ahead of a Politea proposal that would seek funding for a range of outputs from the development phase including:

  - Another Way web series (YouTube, Instagram)
  - Another Way global events (UK, Europe, US, Asia, Africa, South 	America)
  - Establishing Decred UK  	
  - DecentDAO - an alternative implementation of Politea designed to 	facilitate contributions from creative talent distributed around the 	world that also utilises timestamping and ticket voting.  	

**Development phase deliverables**

- **The Another Way 'Big Idea' document**
  -  Introduction, Research, Insight, Strategy, Positioning and Vision of Another Way
  -  How it works as a big idea like Think Different, or Just Do It
  -  Adaptable but structured brand voice that becomes a rallying call 		for the existing community and a driver of future growth.   
  
- **The Decred connection**
  -  How this positioning integrates into the existing values and contributions of the community, whilst demonstrating its value for the future of the ecosystem
  -  How the initiative has the potential to onboard a new community of contributors and contractors, develop entirely new and unique use cases for DCR that drive adoption through events and the content delivered from those events.
  -  How this fits into the long term strategy of Decred’s role as a new kind of workplace and other key ambitions.  	

- **Creative execution**
  -  Bringing alive the 'Another Way' idea through a range of visual media to demonstrate how this idea can launch, adapt and evolve across a range of platforms and areas and expand and contract around more tactical activities.
  -  List of potential interviewees and subjects including connections to Decred but ensuring the editorial independence of the content (this is not marketing in the traditional sense).  		
  -  How the interviewees and areas of discussion would be discussed on Politea to enable input from the community's collective intelligence.
  -  3-5 minute teaser film that would not be for public release but 		that would bring alive the voice and give a good idea for the 		future work.  		
  -  Outline of ongoing Another Way web series designed to play out across social platforms including YouTube and Instagram, but flexible enough to expand beyond those initial distribution channels.   		
  -  Includes budget and schedule for 12 month production period
  -  Outline of ongoing Another Way events that would activate around 		the world through our network
  -  UK, US, Europe, Africa, Asia and South America  		
  -  Includes budget and schedule for 12 month production period
  -  UK marketing proposal to cover core education programme and events and to integrate with various existing crypto events and calendars, whilst providing a base for bringing the wider crypto community into Another Way themed events.
  -  Initial thoughts around the DecentDAO x Politea project, creating a 		new UX and onboarding mechanic for connecting with and responding to proposals from the creative community that enables ticket voting and timestamping.  		
  -  This would be established as a separate but parallel workstream that would follow the launch of the Another Way concept.  		-  Research and accompanying strategy around creative licence for produced work - e.g. If Netflix wanted us to turn the Another Way web series / podcasts etc into a global documentary series, how 		would this relate to the initial open-source production. 
  -  How this creative execution maintains clear connection and 		relevance to the Decred ecosystem.

- **Another Way branding ideas**.  	
  -  Visuals, tone, colours, fonts, icons

- **Distribution, community development and geographic focus**
  -  How this will reach, engage and influence our intended targets - the creative community
  -  A dedicated seeding strategy that will ensure the content connects with relevant groups and communities, driving cultural relevance across a broad range of areas.  		
  -  Suggestions for how this integrates with and iterates on Decred's existing YouTube presence and broader social media.  		
  -  How the Another Way idea works at a range of geographic scales - global and local, giving a toolkit that can be activated by a broad range of contributors and contractors in a tone of voice that is	culturally relevant to their market.  		
  -  How Another Way is activated and leveraged through Decred’s existing network alongside driving awareness and adoption in local markets from people and communities not currently connected to the project.

- **Success metrics**
  -  How we will value our contribution, what signals are we looking 		for, what do we feel is the best way to measure progress

**Who?**

 Our experience sits at the intersection of multi-platform storytelling, community development and emerging technology, alongside an ambition to work on projects that exist to serve the public interest.

 We have co-founded and scaled a number of digital media startups that are built around passionate fan communities such as football and live music on a range of social networks and have worked consistently across projects developed for the public good with broadcasters like the BBC and Channel 4.

 Our journey to cryptocurrency came in 2011 when we launched a social game on Facebook and saw how effectively virtual goods and an in game currency could be for incentivising, rewarding and coordinating community activities on digital networks. Unfortunately, as the game was breaking through into the mainstream and with 15m players, Facebook killed the entire social games industry demonstrating the platform risk inherent in the current system.

 We followed that by building a global digital media brand around the world’s most popular sport - football, that was funded through a traditional ad supported media model. The project reasserted our belief that misaligned incentives in digital advertising supported models would continue to be the limiting factor when attempting to sustain the creative energy and enthusiasm of creative contributors from around the world.

 With social networks becoming increasingly misaligned with their users, we have been searching for a sustainable funding, governance and incentive structure that could facilitate a distributed network of creative talent to tell stories with purpose that exist to serve the public good.   

 We have spent time investing in and developing proposals around a range of crypto projects that have focussed on addressing three key areas - governance, sustainable funding and projects that prioritise the public good.

 After an immense amount of research and experience in this space, we returned to Decred since it was becoming obvious that the project’s team were guided by the same public good principles that we were and that there was immense potential to add value to the project across a number of areas.

 [Decent Partners Ltd](https://decent.partners/), an established UK company would be contracted as a Decred contractor.

 **When?**

This proposal will be signed off as part of the Decred Marketing discretionary funds.

We estimate 6 weeks for delivery, dependent on initial community feedback.   

**Costs?**

 Initial development: $32,200 (£25,000)
